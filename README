Set environmental variable DUC2001_ORIGINAL to point to the file called:
DUC2001_Summarization_Documents.tgz
You should have received this file in an email from NIST.

Do not untar DUC2001 official data. I had to rename some files do to errors in the original duc data.
Single doc scripts does not create data for FBIS documents since these are very different in style and format from the other documents.
There are only a handful of FBIS documents so this shouldn't be a big deal.
Also for some reason, FT934-10911 does not have a single doc summary in the original summaries data so I skipped it.
